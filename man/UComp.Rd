\description{
A package for fast automatic identification of Time series models of several kinds
}
\details{
UComp is a package for time series modelling and forecasting of 
times series models inspired on different sources:
     1. the structural Unobserved Components models due to A.C. Harvey (Basic Structural Model: BSM), enhanced with automatic identification 
tools by Diego J. Pedregal. 
     2. ExponenTial Smoothing by R.J. Hyndman and colaborators.
The package is designed for automatic identification 
among a wide range of possible models for trends, cycles, seasonal and irregular 
components. The models may include exogenous variables. ARMA irregular components 
and automatic detection of outliers are also possible.
